<h1>NovelPerspective</h1>
<p>This tool detects the main/point-of-view character for each chapter of a book, and allows you create a copy of the ebook with just the chapters about the characters you are interested in.
This is not how the author intended it to be read, but you are a free to consume their works how you want, particularly on a second read through.</p>

<img src="site-graphic.svg" title="Jane is the best character, I want to only read the chapter's about Jane.
NovelPerspective is a tool to let you do just that."/>


<p> Please upload the novel to analyse, and restructure.</p>
<p>ePub format is preferred. <br/>
<a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html">Calibre</a> is used to convert other formats,
and is also used to preform any of the additional preprocessing options on the right.
For full control you can run all these functions locally then just upload an ePub.

<p>
Unusual formatting/production of some ebooks may cause issues.
Enabling ePub preprocessing may help for ePub files.
There should be few problems with modern retail epubs, but may cause issues e.g. for files converted from PDF.

<p>
If your web-browser does not render "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" web-pages as the chunks arrive,
this web-app may appear very slow as you will be waiting for all the computation to complete before output is shown.
Most browsers should be capable of chunked transfer and should have no issues.
