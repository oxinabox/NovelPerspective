<h1>Novel Perspective</h1>
<p>Please upload the novel to analyse, and restructure.<p>
<p>Epub format is preferred.</p>
<p>Other formats will attempt to be coverted using <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html">Calibre</a>. This may cause a noticable delay, and may not work well.<p>
<p>If the epub file does not divide into chapters this will not work at all.
This will not be a problem for most retail epubs, but may cause issues e.g. for files converted from PDF.
</p>

    
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" action="upload" method="post">
