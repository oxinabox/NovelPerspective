A tool for modifying (transforming) ebooks, based on the point of view character. Epic fantasy novels are notable for their large cast of Point of View characters. Sometimes you just donâ€™t care for some of them, or you want to read just a single characters story-line, for example on a second read through. NovelPerspectives uses machine learning to discover the main character of a chapter, and transforms the book to include or exclude characters.

 - The `serve` folder contrains the web-app code
 - The `proto` folder contained all our evaulations and the "brains" of our system.
     - We do not include any of the data used in the evaluations, as this would have obvious copyright issues
     - The ebooks that form the basis of our datasets are available from many online stores
     - All preprocessing to load them up and convert them to the exact form we used for processing is included.
