<h1>Novel Perspective</h1>
<p>Please upload the novel to analyse<p> 
<p>Epub format is preferred. Other formats will attempt to be coverted using <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/ebook-convert.html">Calibre</a><p>
<p>If the epub file does not divide into chapters (Most retail epubs will) this will not work at all.</p>
